### üëã Hi there!

I'm a software engineer with 14 years of totall experience. Started with development banking software in Delphi 7. Then moved through ActionScript and PHP to current stack of Typescript for Vue.js/WebRTC apps. Have passion for reading RFC overnight. In the last couple of years I started planning frontend applications architecture and managing small team of 30 frontend developers. I still spend some time developing myself though. 

I'm really into experimenting with brand new and ongoing technologies - right now it is WebCodecs, TensorFlow.js, and WebTransport. Previosly had practical experience with MediaStream Recording API, Intl, WebAR and WebUSB.
 
I use my free time to help creating social media projects (in collaboration with charity fund [Nuzhna pomosh](https://nuzhnapomosh.ru/)) that educate people about HIV/AIDS, bullning, poverty and other terrible things. I do it because I believe in social journalism and its role in making our world a better place. 
Some of this projects got international awards:
- ["It's complicated"](https://takiedela.ru/vseslozhno/en) Interactive movie about HIV [Award Winner in BEST DRAMA nomination Webfest Berlin 2018](https://www.webfest.berlin/2018-award-winners)
- [Attitude towards homeless people and homelessness](https://takiedela.ru/homeless/en/)  [Winners of G8 2017 in nomination Non-commercial Projects](https://2017.ggggggggfest.com/en/works/362)
- ["Warm waters, Kamchatka" by Vlad Sokhin](https://takiedela.ru/kamchatka/) [Award for the Best Digital News Story Visa pour l‚Äôimage](https://www.visapourlimage.com/en/festival/awards-and-grants/visa-d-or-de-l-information-numerique-franceinfo)

Love to speak at small regional IT-conferences because I think that helps young specialists from remote regions skill up and fight regional social inequality.
